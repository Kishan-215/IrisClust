# IrisClust

 - IrisClust is a project that demonstrates the use of the KMeans clustering algorithm on the famous Iris dataset. This project identifies the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and visualizes the resulting clusters.

**Introduction**
  - IrisClust leverages the KMeans algorithm to perform clustering on the Iris dataset. The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and the results are visualized to show how the data points are grouped.

**Dataset**

  - The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is labeled with three species of iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

**Results**

  - The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, which is found to be 3 for the Iris dataset. The clusters are visualized using a scatter plot, with data points colored by their cluster labels.
